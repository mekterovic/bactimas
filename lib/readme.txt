These jars are here just for the git's sake.
(a)
	When developing, reference them from somewhere else, outside eclipse project path.
	(otherwise Eclipse will recognize them and set a relative path that will not be found when the Icy plugin changes home folder to Icy)
(b)
	In the deployed plugin I extract them into my jar (the other option is for user to manualy copy them to ICY_HOME/lib)
